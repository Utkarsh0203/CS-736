The main.m file here was used to generate the pointset for the ellipses. The script when run with a corresponding file, generates the boundary of the ellipse after converting it to a binary image. The code then finds the points that are at maximum and minimum distances from the centroid. We then manually select these points so as to get the points on each extreme of the major and minor axes and feed them in the mat array. The code when run again gives the 16 required points starting from a point on the major axis and going counter-clockwise. Doing this 150 times, we saved each result into a 2x16x150 matrix which is stored in the ellipsePointsetFinal.mat file.

mod_a and mod1 are helper functions defined to have our effective mod(a,b) values from 1 to b rather than from 0 to b-1.
